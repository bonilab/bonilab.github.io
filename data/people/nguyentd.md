**Trần Đăng Nguyên** received his PhD from Open University (UK) in May 2016 with a thesis focused on individual-based simulations of malaria drug-resistance evolution.   Nguyen spent several years on the development of this population-level malaria microsimulation and it now explicitly tracks parasitaemia levels, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, host immunity, variable biting rates, and multiple drug-resistant alleles.   The simulation is open source and can be compiled for Mac/Linux from its [source repository](http://j.mp/oms-v302).   The original purpose of this model was to evaluate if using multiple first-line therapies (MFT) at a population level has beneficial long-term health outcomes.   Nguyen is currently working on subsequent phases of this modeling work, looking at optimal treatmentcourse durations when several treatments are available and optimal ways to introduce new antimalarial combinations into population-level use when they become available.
